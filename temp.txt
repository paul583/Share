You're right; the kernel appears to already be compiled, as the `vmlinuz` and `System.map` files are present in the directory. This simplifies the process since you don't need to compile the kernel from source. Instead, you'll focus on installing the precompiled kernel in NixOS.

Here's how you can proceed:

---

### 1. **Move the Kernel Files**
Ensure the kernel files are in a directory that you can reference later. For simplicity, you can copy them to `/boot`:

```bash
sudo cp vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944 /boot/vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5
sudo cp System.map-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944 /boot/System.map-6.13.0-rc5
```

---

### 2. **Update the NixOS Configuration**
Add a reference to the custom kernel in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_5_15.override {
    kernel = "/boot/vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5";
    kernelSystemMap = "/boot/System.map-6.13.0-rc5";
  };
}
```

---

### 3. **Rebuild the NixOS Configuration**
Apply the changes to your NixOS configuration:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

This step updates the system configuration and ensures the boot loader references the new kernel.

---

### 4. **Reboot into the New Kernel**
Reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### 5. **Verify the Kernel Version**
After rebooting, check that the new kernel is running:

```bash
uname -r
```

The output should match `6.13.0-rc5`.

---

### Alternative: Set Up as a Custom Kernel Package
If you prefer to use a declarative approach in NixOS, you can define the kernel as a custom package in a `.nix` file. Let me know if you'd like help with that!




  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackagesFor (pkgs.linux.override {
    version = "6.13.0-rc5";
    src = pkgs.fetchurl {
      url = "https://github.com/Jackler87/linux/releases/download/v51/kernel-files-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944.tar.gz";
      sha256 = "your_sha256_hash_here"; # Replace with the actual SHA-256 hash
    };
  });
