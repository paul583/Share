You're right; the kernel appears to already be compiled, as the `vmlinuz` and `System.map` files are present in the directory. This simplifies the process since you don't need to compile the kernel from source. Instead, you'll focus on installing the precompiled kernel in NixOS.

Here's how you can proceed:

---

### 1. **Move the Kernel Files**
Ensure the kernel files are in a directory that you can reference later. For simplicity, you can copy them to `/boot`:

```bash
sudo cp vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944 /boot/vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5
sudo cp System.map-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944 /boot/System.map-6.13.0-rc5
```

---

### 2. **Update the NixOS Configuration**
Add a reference to the custom kernel in your `configuration.nix`:

```nix
{
  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_5_15.override {
    kernel = "/boot/vmlinuz-6.13.0-rc5";
    kernelSystemMap = "/boot/System.map-6.13.0-rc5";
  };
}
```

---

### 3. **Rebuild the NixOS Configuration**
Apply the changes to your NixOS configuration:

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch
```

This step updates the system configuration and ensures the boot loader references the new kernel.

---

### 4. **Reboot into the New Kernel**
Reboot your system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

### 5. **Verify the Kernel Version**
After rebooting, check that the new kernel is running:

```bash
uname -r
```

The output should match `6.13.0-rc5`.

---

### Alternative: Set Up as a Custom Kernel Package
If you prefer to use a declarative approach in NixOS, you can define the kernel as a custom package in a `.nix` file. Let me know if you'd like help with that!




  boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackagesFor (pkgs.linux.override {
    version = "6.13.0-rc5";
    src = pkgs.fetchurl {
      url = "https://github.com/Jackler87/linux/releases/download/v51/kernel-files-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944.tar.gz";
      sha256 = "your_sha256_hash_here"; # Replace with the actual SHA-256 hash
    };
  });











The string you've provided, `27b6341f43a3dc832722974ac0da39481572900b033cecdd705e78ecf546d283`, appears to be a SHA-256 hash. In the context of Nix, such a hash is crucial for verifying the integrity of downloaded files, ensuring that the content matches the expected state.

**Using the SHA-256 Hash in Nix**

When incorporating external sources into your Nix expressions, it's essential to specify the correct hash to maintain reproducibility and security. Here's how you can utilize the provided hash:

1. **Define the Source in Your Nix Expression:**

   If you're fetching a file using `fetchurl`, you can specify the URL and the corresponding SHA-256 hash:

   ```nix
   src = fetchurl {
     url = "https://github.com/Jackler87/linux/releases/download/v51/kernel-files-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944.tar.gz";
     sha256 = "27b6341f43a3dc832722974ac0da39481572900b033cecdd705e78ecf546d283";
   };
   ```

   This configuration tells Nix to download the file from the specified URL and verifies its integrity against the provided SHA-256 hash.

2. **Incorporate the Source into a Derivation:**

   If you're building a package that depends on this source, include it in your derivation:

   ```nix
   { stdenv, fetchurl, ... }:

   stdenv.mkDerivation {
     name = "custom-kernel";
     version = "6.13.0-rc5";

     src = fetchurl {
       url = "https://github.com/Jackler87/linux/releases/download/v51/kernel-files-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944.tar.gz";
       sha256 = "27b6341f43a3dc832722974ac0da39481572900b033cecdd705e78ecf546d283";
     };

     # Additional build instructions...
   }
   ```

   This setup ensures that the source is correctly fetched and verified during the build process.

**Verifying the Hash**

If you want to confirm that the downloaded file matches the provided hash, you can use the following command:

```bash
nix hash file /path/to/kernel-files-6.13.0-rc5-g28753b266944.tar.gz
```

Replace `/path/to/` with the actual path to your downloaded file. This command will compute the SHA-256 hash of the file, which you can compare against the provided hash to ensure they match.

**Conclusion**

Including the correct SHA-256 hash in your Nix expressions is vital for maintaining the integrity and reproducibility of your builds. By specifying the hash, you ensure that Nix can verify the downloaded content, preventing issues arising from content changes or tampering.

Additionally, discussions on the NixOS Discourse, such as [Builtins.fetchurl vs nixpkgs.fetchurl](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/builtins-fetchurl-vs-nixpkgs-fetchurl/24133), provide insights into the differences between various fetchers in Nix.

*Ensure that your Nix expressions are correctly configured to maintain system stability and reproducibility.*
